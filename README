This repo serves two purposes: 1) it serves as a sandbox in which I develop
Qlue and experiment with new features and 2) shows how to structure and
implement a web application that relies on Qlue. Actually, for this latter
purpose I go beyond Qlue and present here some ideas about database operations,
scheduling, some application code, etc.
